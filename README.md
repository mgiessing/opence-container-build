# OpenCE Container Images

This repository provides container images for [Open-CE](https://github.com/open-ce) environments.

Images are preconfigured with the corresponding build version from [FTP Orgeon State University](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/open-ce/).

It is divided into 3 major frameworks: <br>
PyTorch, Tensorflow & Onnx<br>
<br>
Each framwork comes in 4 flavors:<br>
- GPU-python3
- CPU-python3
- GPU-jupyter
- CPU-jupyter
